Today I made a breakthrough and manage to connect both the sensor and the stepper motor.
On hack day I recieved the parts for our product and started working on it, everything went well and I manage
to have both the sensor and motor done. The sensor is pretty self explanitory but the motor is there so it causes
the vibrationa and noise to alert the user.
Today I also will be making the prototype design with cardboard and the measurements so that our scrum can add stuff and eventually
our design can start designing and improving.
What I will do is that I will start working on the Transmittor and Reciever so that the motor can act independently.
I'm not stuck on anything for now.
