Progress in the development side:
I've downloaded Arduino IDE and should have all the dependencies for it to work with things like sensors and transmittors. 
I will start working on the base, I'm not able to actually work with the sensors and transmitor because I don't have the Arduino board or parts as of now.
I have started testing some C and C++ code because I do now some C, I've decided to go with these languages because they are fast!
Arduino also uses a form of C++ so there's that.

I did help my group on other things such as the manual page and the survey.
