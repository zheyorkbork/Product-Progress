# Stable

This is the Stable branch.
If Code or Extensions are here, it means it is rid of errors and works flawlessly
There is another seperate branch called: THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH.

#D0 NOT WORRY

The Development branch is just what the name implies, Under Development.
Once the Development Branch is rid of bugs and errors and is funcitonal it is then sent here.
