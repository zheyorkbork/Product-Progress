Today we decided to change our design because a lot of people thought that the piece of tech is big and that people were going to wear a box.
The parts for our product will arrive soon and I've been testing some C++ code and messing around with the Arduino IDE. Right now I'm just waiting on the sensor, transmittor, reciever and motor but currently have the Arduino Board.
also Updated the manual.
